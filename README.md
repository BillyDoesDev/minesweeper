## Installation
Simply clone the repository, cd into it and run `minesweeper.py`
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DarkKnight450/minesweeper.git
cd minesweeper
python minesweeper.py
```

## Usage
```
usage: minesweeper.py [-h] [-v] [-r rows] [-c colums] [-m mines]

CLI Minesweeper written in Python3

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --version  show program's version number and exit
  -r rows        Number of rows in the grid [Defaults to 10]
  -c colums      Number of columns in the grid [Defaults to 10]
  -m mines       Total number of mines [Defaults to 10].
                 If you set an abnormal value, the program 
                 will try to normalise the number of mines on its own.
```

## Note:
The program will throw an error if the window is too small for your entered board size. To fix it, either resize your terminal window, or reduce the board size.

(Yeah, I'm not going for a try catch hell, or doing something that fixes your stupid inputs. Cry about it.)
